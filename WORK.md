### Work

TODOS:
- refactor front end messy code
- better prompt engineering to actually give useful feedback to user (use the web tool to iterate quickly)
- have tooling run on commit
- have a clear template of what you actually want the workflow to look like

frontend wishlist
- show the user what they said (their transcript) (replace the button with the text)
- more than one message
- show record volume and duration, cap recording at 30 seconds or something

MVP:
- present user with a prompt
- convert audio to text
- feed text to GPT (prompt engineer GPT to give feedback in a structured format)
- present user with summary of what to focus on, perhaps an opportunity to repeat
- mock API endpoints so we dont waste credits!!!

Later:
- tests with api mocks 
- GPT model fallback
- actually create a UI for this
- have the prompts be in audio format as well
- define categories where mistakes are being made, areas for the student to focus
- track "progress" over time, (store metrics for the user)


Principles:
- everything should be easy to scale, if we need more content it should be easy to be generated by GPT


GPT "Get to the point" Prompt
```
I am working on a programming project. I am going to ask you some questions, and I need your responses to be short, and straight to the point, without compromising on important details. No need for full sentences or flowery language, the main goal is that I can understand the answers quickly and visually parse out the information I need as fast as possible. ok?
```
