### Work

TODOS:
- have a clear template of what you actually want the workflow to look like
- better prompt engineering

MVP:
- present user with a prompt
- convert audio to text
- feed text to GPT (prompt engineer GPT to give feedback in a structured format)
- present user with summary of what to focus on, perhaps an opportunity to repeat
- mock API endpoints so we dont waste credits!!!

Later:
- GPT model fallback
- actually create a UI for this
- have the prompts be in audio format as well
- define categories where mistakes are being made, areas for the student to focus
- track "progress" over time, (store metrics for the user)

Principles:
- everything should be easy to scale, if we need more content it should be easy to be generated by GPT


GPT "Get to the point" Prompt
```
I am working on a programming project. I am going to ask you some questions, and I need your responses to be short, and straight to the point, without compromising on important details. No need for full sentences or flowery language, the main goal is that I can understand the answers quickly and visually parse out the information I need as fast as possible. ok?
