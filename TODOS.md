### TODOS
- [ ] refactor front end code
- [ ] improve interaction with better prompt engineering (use the web playground tool to iterate quickly)
- [ ] have tooling run on commit
- [ ] show record volume and duration, cap recording (e.g. 30s)
- [ ] tests with mock API calls
- [ ] GPT model fallback
- [ ] integrate text to speech for the tutor
- [ ] define categories where mistakes are being made, areas for the student to focus
